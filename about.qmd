I’m an AI/ML Engineer with a research-oriented mindset and hands-on experience across natural language processing, deep learning, and intelligent systems. 
Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to impactful projects that bridge cutting-edge machine learning techniques with real-world applications in heritage science, 
linguistics, aerospace, and software reliability.

I thrive at the intersection of research and engineering, where experimentation meets execution. 
My work is driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a desire to create AI systems that are transparent, efficient, and impactful.
