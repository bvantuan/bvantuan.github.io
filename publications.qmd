*We explore the fine-tuning of several state-of-the-art neural
transformers for each MWE type. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of the combined system over
multi-task approaches or single-task models, addressing the challenges posed by diverse tagsets within the training
data. Specifically, we evaluated the combined system on a French treebank named Sequoia, which features an
annotation layer encompassing all syntactic types of French MWEs. With this combined approach, we improved the
F1-score by approximately 3% on the Sequoia dataset.*

**Protocol Recognition in Virtual Avionics Network Based on Efficient and Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network**
M. Kerkech, V. ‑T. Bui, M. Africano, L. Martin and K. Srinivasarengan (2022)
*IEEE/ACM 26th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS‑RT)*, Alès, France, 2022, pp. 9‑16, doi: 10.1109/DS‑RT55542.2022.9932068.

*In this work,
we present AvioNet, a lightweight, computation-efficient neural
network for virtual avionics network protocol recognition with
accuracy and latency levels as required by aerospace systems.
This method converts each packet into a common gray image,
and then uses the depthwise separable convolution, pointwise
group convolution and channel shuffle operations to automatically extract the appropriate spatial features. This reduces the
computational complexity significantly while maintaining almost
the same accuracy. This CNN-based classifier is verified on data
that has non-avionic protocols mixed with avionic simulated
protocols and is compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
Experimental results show that the accuracy of the method
exceeds 99.999% for avionics simulated dataset and outperforms
other deep learning classifiers. Furthermore, the method provides
low-latency guarantees that aerospace systems demand.*
