A summary of my professional roles and educational background. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and continuously learning new skills.

## Professional Experience

### NLP Research Engineer | Fondation des Sciences du Patrimoine (FSP) | Apr 2024 – Apr 2025

*   Extracted named entities (metadata, paradata) from unstructured cultural heritage analysis data using LLMs, Prompting, and RAG to ensure provenance and traceability.
*   Optimized named entity extraction through the implementation of **LLM reasoning techniques** (Chain-of-Thought, internal reasoning).
*   Fine‑tuned **Whisper models with LoRA** on cultural heritage audio data, enhancing transcription accuracy of domain‑specific named entities by
5%.
*   Linked extracted entities to Opentheso and ORCID knowledge bases, strengthening data accessibility and traceability.
*   Partnered with heritage science experts (documentalists, conservators, restorers) to create training and evaluation datasets.

### Data Science Research Engineer | Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) | Feb 2023 – Feb 2024

*   Automated the release of new versions of the PARSEME corpora across **26 languages via GitLab CI/CD**, considerably reducing publication times.
*   Designed and implemented new modules for quality control of linguistic corpora.
*   Unified and integrated PARSEME’s disparate tools, increasing **operational efficiency by 50%**.
*   Enhanced French multiword expression identification F1-score by 10% leveraging **CamemBERT and FlauBERT models**.
*   Built an inference pipeline on lab clusters to identify multiword expressions in a large 21GB corpus.

### Deep Learning Intern | Capgemini Engineering | Mar 2022 – Aug 2022

*   Designed and implemented a lightweight, efficient CNN for avionics protocol recognition using Tensorflow, achieving aerospace‑standard **$10$ms latency and error
rate below $10^{-5}$**.
*   Collaborated with simulation team to enhance protocol recognition through data collection, analysis and production testing.
*   Orchestrated the deployment of the recognition model on **AWS Cloud and Raspberry Pi 4** using TensorFlow Lite, ensuring optimal performance.
*   Developed and launched an intuitive, interactive dashboard using Dear PyGui for real‑time monitoring of model performance in production.
*   Developed substitution models using Transformer for dynamic systems.

### Artificial Intelligence Intern | OLGHAM | Apr 2021 – Aug 2021

*   Programmed Scannol, an AI‑based auditing tool using **expert systems** to detect anomalies in C/C++ code.
*   Tracked down and identified efficiently functional errors in each of the **4 source codes analyzed**.
*   Adopted and mastered the demanding DO‑178C development standards.

## Education

### M.S. in Computer Science and Computer Security | INSA Centre Val de Loire | 2017 – 2022
