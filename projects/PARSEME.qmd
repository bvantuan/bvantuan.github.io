# PARSEME Corpora

The [PARSEME multilingual corpora](https://gitlab.com/parseme/corpora/-/wikis/home) have been annotated with VMWEs to serve, notably, as both training and testing resources for shared tasks [@savary2017parseme; @ramisch2018edition; @ramisch2020edition]
, with the aim of enhancing the identification of VMWEs in written content. Presently in version 1.3, the PARSEME corpora encompass 26 languages, including French. Collectively, the corpora comprise $455,629$ sentences, equivalent to 9 million tokens, and $127,498$ VMWEs. Specifically, the French corpus contains $20,961$ sentences, equivalent to $525,842$ tokens, with $5,655$ annotated VMWEs .

The VMWE types are detailed in the annotation guidelines.[^guidelines] The VMWE types annotated specifically for French are as follows:

* IRV (inherently reflexive verbs): e.g. ***s’évanouir*** (lit. ‘to faint oneself’) ‘to faint’
* LVC.full (light verb constructions in which the verb is semantically totally bleached): e.g. ***faire** une **présentation*** ‘to make a presentation’
* LVC.cause (light verb constructions in which the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun): e.g. ***donner** le **droit*** ‘to grant the right’
* VID (verbal idioms ): e.g. ***se faire des idées*** (lit. ‘make oneself ideas’) ‘to imagine something false’
* MVC (multi-verb constructions): e.g. *ce mot **veut dire** autre chose* (lit. ‘this word wants to mean something else’) ‘this word means something else’
